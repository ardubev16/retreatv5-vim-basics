Description: Following are some text sections, in each section you will practice
    the following methods of entering insert mode:

    i: Insert before cursor
    a: Append after cursor
    I: Insert at beginning of line
    A: Append at end of line
    o: new line below
    O: new line above
    Esc: to go back to Normal mode
Objective: In each section there will be couple of lines, you must modify the first one
    in order to match the second using the letter indicated in the header of the section.
    Before each line put your cursor on the arrow first, and remember to NEVER use arrows!!!
