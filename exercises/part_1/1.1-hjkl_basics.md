Welcome to the Vim hjkl practice session. This text is designed to help you navigate `1` efficiently.
Using the `2` keys on your keyboard, try to move `3` to the numbered points in this text.
Each `4` number is placed in a specific part of the text to help you practice.
Notice how `5` you can quickly move to different parts of the line using hjkl.
Try to reach `6` the next number by moving right, left, up, or down.
Once you've reached `7` the end of this line, try using different motions to go back.
The more `8` you practice, the faster you'll become at navigating in Vim.
Can you find `9` all the numbers in this text without using the arrow keys?
Practice `10` makes perfect, so keep moving until you feel confident.
