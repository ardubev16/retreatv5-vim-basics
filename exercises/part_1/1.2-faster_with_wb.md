Description: This is the same text as before (I know, I'm lazy :) ), this time
    you will use different keys to move horizontally:
                k: up
    b: word Back       w: Word right
                j: down
Objective: Move through the text, try to put your cursor on all numbers in order and
    go back in order WITHOUT using the arrow keys and hl.

Welcome to the Vim hjkl practice session. This text is designed to help you navigate `1` efficiently.
Using the `2` keys on your keyboard, try to move `3` to the numbered points in this text.
Each number is placed in a specific `4` part of the text to help you practice.
Notice how `5` you can quickly move to different parts of the line using hjkl.
Try to reach the next number by moving right, left, up, or `6` down.
Once you've reached the end of this `7` line, try using different motions to go back.
The more you practice, `8` the faster you'll become at navigating in Vim.
Can you find all the numbers in this text without using `9` the arrow keys?
Practice `10` makes perfect, so keep moving until you feel confident.
